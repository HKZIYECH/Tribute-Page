            <b>Following his doctorate, Lemma returned to his home country, Ethiopia, where he obtained a position at the then Haile Selassie I University. He founded the Institute of Pathobiology, now known as the Aklilu Lemma Institute of Pathobiology, and taught there until 1976, when he left it for a job in the United Nations. 
              <br> <br> <br>
              He served the UN in many capacities as a scientist, became the Deputy Director of UNICEF's International Child Development Centre, now known as UNICEF's Innocenti Research Centre and finally obtained a position in his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University.
<br><br><br>
                He made his most important scientific discovery very early in his career, in 1964, when he discovered a natural treatment to schistosomiasis, also known as snail fever disease or bilharzia, a debilitating disease caused by the parasitic worm Schistosoma, which is spread by freshwater snails. 
<br><br><br>
                He found that berries from the endod plant, which is commonly used to make soap and shampoos in many parts of Africa, is a potent, inexpensive and safe molluscicide, to prevent the spread of the parasitic worm. This discovery made the plant an object of scientific research in many parts of the world. 
<br><br><br>
                Lemma himself was at the forefront of this research. His work acquired an international reputation, which in turn led to various awards, including honorary doctorate degrees.
<br><br><br>
                The most prestigious award was the one he won together with his research associate, Dr. Legesse Wolde-Yohannes in November 1989 â€“ the Right Livelihood Award of Sweden, commonly referred to as the Alternative Nobel Prize.
                
                He died in the United States on 5 April 1997 and was buried in Ethiopia, on 13 April. </b>

            <li>
                <b>1997</b> - Lemma and colleagues established the Endod Foundation to serve as an umbrella for all endod-related work. Following collaboration with Lemma, the University of Toledo, USA, was granted a US patent on an endod-based molluscicide intended to control the zebra mussels which have recently invaded American lakes and caused extensive damage to water supplies. This has opened a major new hope for marketing and exporting endod as a cash crop.
